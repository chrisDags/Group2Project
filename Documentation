Minecraft server
The instance running a mine craft server. 
1. 	Run the VM docker to hold the Minecraft server
2. 	SSH key to the server
3. 	Make a public IP address from the server
4. 	Install java on the MV ware machine
5. 	Install Minecraft server software, downloading the files
6. 	Run the files (server)
7. 	Edit the files, managing the Minecraft server (scripting to bootstrap, start, stop, backup, restore, and automating deployment)
8. 	Open port in the server network (have to find what port that will be), we should find out if we can manually tell Minecraft what ports will be used
9. 	Want a security list, ingress rules (at least 2: destination port range (TCP), protocol UDP traffic)
10.  Open the ports on the VMâ€™s firewall
11.  Star the server, DONE
