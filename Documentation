Minecraft server

Steps to run a Minecraft server on an Ubuntu Server image loaded onto an OpenStack instance. 

1.  Instantiate an OpenStack profile. Only one compute and one controller node will be necessary.
2.  Launch an instance of Ubuntu Server on OpenStack.
3. 	SSH key to the server
4. 	Make a public IP address from the server
5. 	Install Java on the Ubuntu Server image
6. 	Install Minecraft server software, downloading the files
7. 	Run the files (server)
8. 	Edit the files, managing the Minecraft server (scripting to bootstrap, start, stop, backup, restore, and automating deployment)
9. 	Open port in the server network (have to find what port that will be), we should find out if we can manually tell Minecraft what ports will be used
10. Want a security list, ingress rules (at least 2: destination port range (TCP), protocol UDP traffic)
11. Open the ports on the VMâ€™s firewall
12. Start the server, DONE
